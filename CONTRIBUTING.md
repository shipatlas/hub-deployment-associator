## Development

### Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` (they'll be places in `./node_modules`).
3. Make your changes and commit them.
4. Run `npm run lint` to run linting tests and address any issues raised (or `npm run lint-fix` to auto-correct any violations).
4. Prepare compiled files using `npm run prepare` and commit them.
